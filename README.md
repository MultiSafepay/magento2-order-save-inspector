# Order Save Inspector by MultiSafepay

## General information

This module is created as an example of how to properly debug issues related with race conditions which occur when multiple processes try to save the order.
This module is not considered as a perfect solution that will always work in every case.
Please use with caution. Always test on a staging environment first, before moving this over to production.

This module will probably not give an immediate answer to your problem, but will hopefully bring you a step closer to finding the cause of it.
